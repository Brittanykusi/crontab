The Division of Cell Biology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology have studied the structural aspects of the vaccinia virus and its interaction with various antibodies. Live Vaccinia virus elicits antibodies to smallpox and monkeypox but does not replicate efficiently in humans. The virus is used to produce the two vaccines currently approved by the CDC for the prevention of monkeypox.  Crystals of proteins related to monkeypox virus are being prepared for structural studies to assess this issue.   Other SSRL users are beginning research programs with the goal of therapeutics developments to combat monkeypox and related poxviridae.  This work will lead to the development of new monkeypox vaccines and antiviral drugs."}

The mutations in the outbreak viruses are driven by human enzyme cAPOBEC3, which is part of the innate immune system.  Other unusual mutation patterns are being defined, along with strategies for dealing with these issues for multiple alignments and studying monkeypox’s emergence in Nigeria. Computational modeling is being used to study the dynamics of distinctive variants to track evidence for evolutionary selection and to understand if the variants have implications for epidemic forecasting.  This work will enable a better understanding of monkeypox virus evolution."}
